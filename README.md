# AdaMaclaurinSeries
My original Maclaurin Series program was written in C++ for my numerical computing class. I thought re writing it in Ada would be a 
good way to learn the language. Maclaurin series is a power series used to calculate an approximation of a function. In my program I prompt the user for 
the number of terms in the series and for t (the argument of the function). I than calculate the series and compare its approximation to the exact value. 
I print out the exact error and the truncation error. In terms utilizing Ada, my program is very simple and was a simple way to learn Adaâ€™s syntax.
